    <h2>HL7 FHIR BOT</h2>
    <p align="left">
    <pre>
    FHIRBot is a conversational chatbot to interact with any FHIR compliant server to obtain or update medical record data using natural
    conversations and commands.

    The BOT architecture is comprised of a network of services and mirco services, including:  An STU3 FHIR Server 
    hosted and backed by Microsoft Azure CosmosDB, Microsoft Azure BOT Framework service, a secure skype channel,
    a secure web channel and Azure AI/Cognitive services (Language Understanding Intelligence Service) to ascertain
    user intent. A sample data monitor application looking for changes to the FHIR server is also presented.
    
    The knolwedge of the FHIR Bot will increase daily as we teach it about new resources.

    The FHIR Bot is presented as an art of the possible solution.  Security measures have been disbaled to allow for public 
    demonstration.  The data contained or inputed into the system is completely fake any data added should not be related to any real person.
